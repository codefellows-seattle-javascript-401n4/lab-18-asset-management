If you want to upload a different file, put a new one in the /test folder.

When starting the test, run "npm test". If you uploaded a new file you want to use, run "npm test yourFileNameHere".

You will need to create a .env file with the follwing properties:

PORT=5000 or your own custom port
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
S3_BUCKET=

I have decided to make the endpoint /resource to simplify things.
